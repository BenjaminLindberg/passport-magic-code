# passport-magic-code

A passwordless authentication strategy for passport.

Mostly used for personal projects, so its made in a way that suits my needs the best.

Zod is a peer dependency, which means it will need to be installed in your project for this plugin to work.

More documentation and testing will hopefully be added in the future.
(WIP)
